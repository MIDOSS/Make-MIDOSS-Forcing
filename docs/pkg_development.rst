The Make-MIDOSS-Forcing package (:kbd:`make_midoss_forcing`) is Make Salish Sea HDF5 Forcing Files for MIDOSS Runs


.. _Make-MIDOSS-ForcingPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6+-blue.svg
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3.7/
    :alt: Python Version

The :kbd:`make_midoss_forcing` package is developed and tested using `Python`_ 3.7 or later.
The package uses some Python language features that are not available in versions prior to 3.6,
in particular:

* `formatted string literals`_
  (aka *f-strings*)
* the `file system path protocol`_

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/
.. _formatted string literals: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings
.. _file system path protocol: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep519


.. _Make-MIDOSS-ForcingGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-hg-blue.svg
    :target: https://bitbucket.org/midoss/make-midoss-forcing/
    :alt: Mercurial on Bitbucket

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from Bitbucket with:

.. _repository: https://bitbucket.org/midoss/make-midoss-forcing/

.. code-block:: bash

    $ hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/midoss/make-midoss-forcing Make-MIDOSS-Forcing

or

.. code-block:: bash

    $ hg clone https://your_userid@bitbucket.org/midoss/make-midoss-forcing Make-MIDOSS-Forcing

if you don't have `ssh key authentication`_ set up on Bitbucket
(replace :kbd:`you_userid` with your Bitbucket userid,
or copy the link from the :guilabel:`Clone` action pop-up on the `repository`_ page).

.. _ssh key authentication: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html


.. _Make-MIDOSS-ForcingDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have the `Anaconda Python Distribution`_ or `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called :kbd:`make-midoss-forcing` that will have all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands below.

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Anaconda Python Distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
.. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd Make-MIDOSS-Forcing
    $ conda env create -f env/environment-dev.yaml
    $ source activate make-midoss-forcing
    (make-midoss-forcing)$ pip install --editable .

The :kbd:`--editable` option in the :command:`pip install` command above installs the package from the cloned repo via symlinks so that the installed package will be automatically updated as the repo evolves.

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (make-midoss-forcing)$ source deactivate


.. _Make-MIDOSS-ForcingCodingStyle:

Coding Style
============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The :kbd:`Make-MIDOSS-Forcing` package uses the `black`_ code formatting tool to maintain a coding style that is very close to `PEP 8`_.

.. _black: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
.. _PEP 8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

:command:`black` is installed as part of the :ref:`Make-MIDOSS-ForcingDevelopmentEnvironment` setup.

To run :command:`black` on the entire code-base use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd Make-MIDOSS-Forcing
    $ conda activate make_midoss_forcing
    (make-midoss-forcing)$ black ./

in the repository root directory.
The output looks something like::

  reformatted /media/doug/warehouse/MIDOSS/Make-MIDOSS-Forcing/make_midoss_forcing/forcing_paths.py
  All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
  1 file reformatted, 6 files left unchanged.


.. _Make-MIDOSS-ForcingBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/make-midoss-forcing/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://make-midoss-forcing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :kbd:`Make-MIDOSS-Forcing` package is written in `reStructuredText`_ and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.
Creating a :ref:`Make-MIDOSS-ForcingDevelopmentEnvironment` as described above includes the installation of Sphinx.
Building the documentation is driven by the :file:`docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`salishsea-nowcast` development environment activated,
use:

.. _reStructuredText: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

.. code-block:: bash

    (make-midoss-forcing)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like::

  Running Sphinx v2.2.1
  making output directory... done
  building [mo]: targets for 0 po files that are out of date
  building [html]: targets for 2 source files that are out of date
  updating environment: [new config] 2 added, 0 changed, 0 removed

  writing additional pages...
  done
  copying static files... ... done
  copying extra files... done
  dumping search index in English (code: en)... done
  dumping object inventory... done
  build succeeded.

  The HTML pages are in _build/html.

The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser to preview the results of the build.

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on Bitbucket,
whenever you push changes to Bitbucket the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://make-midoss-forcing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _Make-MIDOSS-ForcingLinkCheckingTheDocumentation:

Link Checking the Documentation
-------------------------------

Sphinx also provides a link checker utility which can be run to find broken or redirected links in the docs.
With your :kbd:`make-midoss-forcing)` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (make-midoss-forcing))$ cd Make-MIDOSS-Forcing)/docs/
    (make-midoss-forcing)) docs$ make linkcheck

The output looks something like::

  Running Sphinx v2.2.1
  loading pickled environment... done
  building [mo]: targets for 0 po files that are out of date
  building [linkcheck]: targets for 2 source files that are out of date

.. _Make-MIDOSS-ForcingRunningTheUnitTests:

Running the Unit Tests
======================

The test suite for the :kbd:`Make-MIDOSS-Forcing` package is in :file:`Make-MIDOSS-Forcing/tests/`.
The `pytest`_ tool is used for test parametrization and as the test runner for the suite.

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

With your :kbd:`make-midoss-forcing` development environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (make-midoss-forcing)$ cd Make-MIDOSS-Forcing/
    (make-midoss-forcing)$ py.test

to run the test suite.
The output looks something like::

  **add example pytest output**

You can monitor what lines of code the test suite exercises using the `coverage.py`_ tool with the command:

.. _coverage.py: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

.. code-block:: bash

    (make-midoss-forcing)$ cd Make-MIDOSS-Forcing/
    (make-midoss-forcing)$ coverage run -m py.test

and generate a test coverage report with:

.. code-block:: bash

    (make-midoss-forcing)$ coverage report

to produce a plain text report,
or

.. code-block:: bash

    (make-midoss-forcing)$ coverage html

to produce an HTML report that you can view in your browser by opening :file:`Make-MIDOSS-Forcing/htmlcov/index.html`.
